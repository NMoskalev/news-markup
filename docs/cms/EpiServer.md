## EPiServer

* It's recommended to create a separate github repository with a right solution structure, for example [here](https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/ed7564297c61fe9ab814) or [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ee817674(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).
* It's recommended to use standard [EPiServer Foundation project](https://github.com/episerver/Foundation).
* It's recommended to use the latest EPiServer nuget packages.
